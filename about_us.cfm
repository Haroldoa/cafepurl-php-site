          Harold was born and raised in Nicaragua and grew up around the beautiful mountainous reserve of Pe&ntilde;as Blancas. Harold came to the U.S. as a teenager to study but never lost his love of coffee. Harold's fondest memories are spending time with his grandmother drinking coffee and sharing stories. He finds joy debating and conversing philosophical theories over a cup of his home coffee.

Our award winning coffee comes from our family farm, in business for more than 30 years. It's hard to describe how good it tastes. It's uniquely pleasant and very different from most coffee.
